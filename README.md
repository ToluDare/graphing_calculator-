## Ideation
One day Tolu was in her calculus class and her teacher, who explicitly stated that the class was a no calculator class, pulled up desmos, an online graphing calculator, to answer her question💀

At that moment two things came up in Tolu's mind:
1. Wowwwwww🙄

2. "Hnmm🤔, well i know how to make a basic calculator ...and we just learnt how to print images using symbols in class... why don't i make my own GRAPHING CALCULATOR?!?!😀"
   So I took that as a challenge and here we are!!

   Over the course of my Computer Science course I have added unto this project knowldege learnt in class, such as:

   - **graphics.py** for the display of the graph
   - **Stacks** for the processing of variables
   - and of course, **Object Oriented Programming** for structure.
